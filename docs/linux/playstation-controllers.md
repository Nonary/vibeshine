# PlayStation virtual controllers

Linux DS4 and DS5 emulation exposes USB HID devices. The portable descriptor and
feature contracts in Inputtino's `ds4_usb.hpp` and `ds5_usb.hpp` were ported from
the libvirtualgamepad fixes identified in their source comments. Updating the
Windows driver submodule alone does not update these Linux implementations.

Native games inspect feature usages, firmware revisions, calibration, and sensor
initialization before accepting input. Browser or Steam controller detection is
insufficient validation. Unknown feature operations must return an error.

The wire calibration is zero bias, 16 gyro counts per degree/second, and 8192
accelerometer counts per g. Inputtino's public DS5 motion API takes radians/second
and m/s²; Vibeshine's DS4 API takes degrees/second and m/s². Pairing replies must
agree with each device's unique address, in reversed wire order.

Build and run the normal suite, including `test_component_ds4_usb` and
`test_component_ds5_usb`. A separate manual test creates temporary controllers
visible to the desktop and Steam, sends a Cross press and synthetic motion,
and destroys only those controllers:

```sh
timeout 20 build/tests/probe_playstation_uhid
```

This verifies actual Linux UHID descriptors, feature reads/writes, unknown-request
rejection, and input reports. It requires access to `/dev/uhid` and the resulting
hidraw nodes. It does not establish game compatibility through Wine/Proton or
client feedback behavior. After deployment, reconnect the stream to recreate
controllers and validate the affected game with its actual Proton and Steam
Input settings. DS4 and DS5 selections retain their respective device identities;
game-specific translation by Steam or Proton is a separate layer.
